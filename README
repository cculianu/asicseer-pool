ASICseer Pool

Ultra low overhead massively scalable multi-process, multi-threaded modular
Bitcoin Cash mining pool, proxy, passthrough, library and database interface in
C for Linux.  Features SPLNS-style payout scheme.

asicseer-pool is code provided free of charge under the GPLv3 license but its
development is mostly paid for by commissioned funding.

Please consider contributing if you are running it on a pool or contributing to the
authors listed in AUTHORS if you use this code to aid funding further development.

This software is originally based on the work of Con Kolivas' ckpool
   [ckpool-splns](https://bitbucket.org/ckolivas-splns/ckpool/)

It has been updated and reworked to add a features and to support Bitcoin Cash
(rather than Bitcoin).

* Removed segwit
* Added larger merkle tree support (for mining 32MB blocks)
* Added cash address support
* Configurable pool fee support
   - Features 20% of pool fee as a dev donation to Calin (me), and Bitcoin Cash
     Node wallets, by default.
* Added "mindiff_overrides" which allows a pool to give out larger minimum
  and starting difficulty for stratum clients matching a particular user agent
  string (useful for NiceHash, which requires pools have a high difficulty).
* Updated asicseer-db (formerly ckdb) sources to actually compile on modern
  Linux
* Fixed bugs

README follows (modified by Calin from the original to reflect added config
options):

DESIGN:

Architecture:
- Low level hand coded architecture relying on minimal outside libraries beyond
  basic glibc functions for maximum flexibility and minimal overhead that can be
  built and deployed on any Linux installation.
- Multiprocess+multithreaded design to scale to massive deployments and
  capitalise on modern multicore/multithread CPU designs.
- Minimal memory overhead.
- Utilises ultra reliable unix sockets for communication with dependent
  processes.
- Modular code design to streamline further development.
- Standalone library code that can be utilised independently of asicseer-pool.
- Same code can be deployed in many different modes designed to talk to each
  other on the same machine, local lan or remote internet locations.

Modes of deployment:
- Comprehensive pooled mining solution with a postgresql database interface.
- Passthrough node(s) that combine connections to a single socket which can
  be used to scale to millions of clients and allow the main pool to be isolated
  from direct communication with clients.
- Proxy nodes with a database that act as a single client to the upstream pool
  while storing full client data of their own.
- Simple proxy without the limitations of hashrate inherent in other proxy
  solutions when talking to asicseer-pool.
- Simple pool without a database.
- Library for use by other software.

Features:
- Bitcoind communication to unmodified bitcoind with multiple failover to local
  or remote locations.
- Local pool instance worker limited only by operating system resources and
  can be made virtually limitless through use of multiple downstream
  passthrough nodes.
- Proxy and passthrough modes can set up multiple failover upstream pools.
- Optional share logging.
- Virtually seamless restarts for upgrades through socket handover from exiting
  instances to new starting instance.
- Configurable custom coinbase signature.
- Configurable instant starting and minimum difficulty.
- Rapid vardiff adjustment with stable unlimited maximum difficulty handling.
- New work generation on block changes incorporate full bitcoind transaction
  set without delay or requiring to send transactionless work to miners thereby
  providing the best bitcoin network support and rewarding miners with the most
  transaction fees.
- Event driven communication based on communication readiness preventing
  slow communicating clients from delaying low latency ones.
- Stratum messaging system to running clients.
- Accurate pool and per client statistics.
- Multiple named instances can be run concurrently on the same machine.
- SPLNS payout scheme (payout directly to users for each block found)

BUILDING:

Building asicseer-pool standalone without asicseer-db has no dependencies
outside of the basic build tools on any Linux installation.

sudo apt-get install build-essential yasm
./configure --without-asicseer-db
make


Building with asicseer-db requires installation of the postgresql, gsl and ssl
development libraries.

sudo apt-get install build-essential yasm libpq-dev libgsl-dev
./configure --with-asicseer-db
make

older distributions may instead require a different version of gsl:
 sudo apt-get install build-essential libpq-dev libgsl0ldbl libgsl0-dev yasm

N.B.: asicseer-db also requires libssl-dev but libpq-dev depends on it and
      installs it.


Building from git also requires autoconf and automake

sudo apt-get install build-essential yasm libpq-dev libgsl-dev autoconf automake libtool
./autogen.sh
./configure
make


Binaries will be built in the src/ subdirectory. Binaries generated will be:
asicseer-pool - The main pool back end
asicseer-db - The pool's database (only if ./configure --with-asicseer-db)
asicseer-pmsg - An application for passing messages in libasicseerpool format
                to asicseer-pool/asicseer-db
notifier - An application designed to be run with bitcoind's -blocknotify to
           notify asicseer-pool of block changes.


Installation is NOT required and asicseer-pool can be run directly from the
directory it's built in but it can be installed with:
sudo make install


It is anticipated that pool operators wishing to set up a full database based
installation of asicseer-pool+asicseer-db will be familiar with setting up
postgresql and associated permissions to the directories where the various
processes will communicate with each other and a web server so these will not
be documented.

RUNNING:

asicseer-pool supports the following options:

-A | --standalone
-c CONFIG | --config CONFIG
-d DB-NAME | --db-name DB-NAME
-g GROUP | --group GROUP
-H | --handover
-h | --help
-k | --killold
-L | --log-shares
-l LOGLEVEL | --loglevel LOGLEVEL
-N | --node
-n NAME | --name NAME
-P | --passthrough
-p | --proxy
-R | --redirector
-S DB-SOCKDIR | --db-sockdir DB-SOCKDIR
-s SOCKDIR | --sockdir SOCKDIR
-u | --userproxy


-A Standalone mode tells asicseer-pool not to try to communicate with
asicseer-db or log any asicseer-db requests in the rotating db logs it would
otherwise store. All users are automatically accepted without any attempt to
authorise users in any way. This option is explicitly enabled when built without
db support.

-c <CONFIG> tells asicseer-pool to override its default configuration filename
and load the specified one. If -c is not specified, asicseer-pool looks for:
asicseer-pool.conf, in proxy mode it looks for asicseer-proxy.conf, in
passthrough mode for asicseer-passthrough.conf and in redirector mode for
asicseer-redirector.conf

-d <DB-NAME> tells asicseer-pool what the name of the db process is that it should
speak to, otherwise it will look for asicseer-db.
This option does not exist when built without db support.

-g <GROUP> will start asicseer-pool as the group ID specified.

-H will make asicseer-pool attempt to receive a handover from a running
incidence of asicseer-pool with the same name, taking its client listening
socket and shutting it down.

-h displays the above help

-k will make asicseer-pool shut down an existing instance of asicseer-pool with
the same name, killing it if need be. Otherwise asicseer-pool will refuse to
start if an instance of the same name is already running.

-L will log per share information in the logs directory divided by block height
and then workbase.

-l <LOGLEVEL will change the log level to that specified. Default is 5 and
maximum debug is level 7.

-N will start asicseer-pool in passthrough node mode where it behaves like a
passthrough but requires a locally running bitcoind and can submit blocks
itself in addition to passing the shares back to the upstream pool. It also
monitors hashrate and requires more resources than a simple passthrough. Be
aware that upstream pools must specify dedicated IPs/ports that accept
incoming node requests with the nodeserver directive described below.

-n <NAME> will change the asicseer-pool process name to that specified,
allowing multiple different named instances to be running. By default the
variant names are used: asicseer-pool, asicseer-proxy, asicseer-passthrough,
asicseer-redirector, asicseer-node.

-P will start asicseer-pool in passthrough proxy mode where it collates all
incoming connections and streams all information on a single connection to an
upstream pool specified in asicseer-proxy.conf . Downstream users all retain
their individual presence on the master pool. Standalone mode is implied.

-p will start asicseer-pool in proxy mode where it appears to be a local pool
handling clients as separate entities while presenting shares as a single user
to the upstream pool specified. Note that the upstream pool needs to be a
asicseer-pool for it to scale to large hashrates. Standalone mode is Optional.

-R will start asicseer-pool in a variant of passthrough mode. It is designed
to be a front end to filter out users that never contribute any shares. Once an
accepted share from the upstream pool is detected, it will issue a redirect to
one of the redirecturl entries in the configuration file. It will cycle over
entries if multiple exist, but try to keep all clients from the same IP
redirecting to the same pool.

-S <DB-SOCKDIR> tells asicseer-pool which directory to look for the asicseer-db
socket to talk to.
This option does not exist when built without asicseer-db support.

-s <SOCKDIR> tells asicseer-pool which directory to place its own communication
sockets (/tmp by default)

-u Userproxy mode will start asicseer-pool in proxy mode as per the -p option
above, but in addition it will accept username/passwords from the stratum
connects and try to open additional connections with those credentials to the
upstream pool specified in the configuration file and then reconnect miners to
mine with their chosen username/password to the upstream pool.


asicseer-db takes the following options:

-b DBPREFIX | --dbprefix DBPREFIX
-c CONFIG | --config CONFIG
-d DBNAME | --dbname DBNAME
-h | --help
-k | --killold
-l LOGLEVEL | --loglevel LOGLEVEL
-n NAME | --name NAME
-p DBPASS | --dbpass DBPASS
-r POOL-LOGDIR | --pool-logdir POOL-LOGDIR
-R LOGDIR | --logdir LOGDIR
-s SOCKDIR | --sockdir SOCKDIR
-u DBUSER | --dbuser DBUSER
-v | --version
-y | --confirm
-Y CONFIRMRANGE | --confirmrange CONFIRMRANGE


ckpmsg and notifier support the -n, -p and -s options

CONFIGURATION

At least one bitcoind is mandatory in asicseer-pool mode with the minimum
requirements of server, rpcuser and rpcpassword set.

asicseer-pool takes a json encoded configuration file in asicseer-pool.conf by
default or asicseer-proxy.conf in proxy or passthrough mode unless specified
with -c. Sample configurations for asicseer-pool and asicseer-proxy are
included with the source. Entries after the valid json are ignored and the
space there can be used for comments. The options recognised are as follows:


"btcd" : This is an array of bitcoind(s) with the options url, auth  and pass
which match the configured bitcoind. The optional boolean field notify tells
asicseer-pool this btcd is using the notifier and does not need to be polled
for block changes. If no btcd is specified, asicseer-pool will look for one on
localhost:8332 with the username "user" and password "pass". This maintainers
of this software recommend BCHN as the bitcoind node implementation to use.

"proxy" : This is an array in the same format as btcd above but is used in
proxy and passthrough mode to set the upstream pool and is mandatory.

"bchaddress" : This is the bitcoin cash address to try to generate blocks to.
In SPLNS mode it is the fallback address for leftover dust or in case a worker
address is invalid. Both legacy and cashaddr formats are supported.

"bchsig" : This is optional text to put into the coinbase transaction of mined
blocks.

"pool_fee" : The percentage to pay out to the pool "bchaddress" for each found
block, as a floating point percentage of the total mining reward. If unspecified,
1.0 is the default (1%). The pool fee is taken from the total coinbase reward.
Set this value to 0.0 to disable. Values >= 100.0 will be clamped to 100.0.
The pool_fee will appear as the first output in the coinbase transaction.

"blockpoll" : This is the frequency in milliseconds for how often to check for
new network blocks and is 100 by default. It is intended to be a backup only
for when the notifier is not set up and only polls if the "notify" field is
not set on a btcd.

"nodeserver" : This takes the same format as the serverurl array and specifies
additional IPs/ports to bind to that will accept incoming requests for mining
node communications. It is recommended to selectively isolate this address
to minimise unnecessary communications with unauthorised nodes.

"nonce1length" : This is optional allowing the extranonce1 length to be chosen
from 2 to 8. Default 4

"nonce2length" : This is optional allowing the extranonce2 length to be chosen
from 2 to 8. Default 8

"update_interval" : This is the frequency that stratum updates are sent out to
miners and is set to 30 seconds by default to help perpetuate transactions for
the health of the bitcoin network.

"version_mask" : This is a mask of which bits in the version number it is valid
for a client to alter and is expressed as an hex string. Eg "00fff000"
Default is "1fffe000".

"serverurl" : This is the IP(s) to try to bind asicseer-pool uniquely to,
otherwise it will attempt to bind to all interfaces in port 3333 by default in
pool mode and 3334 in proxy mode. Multiple entries can be specified as an array
by either IP or resolvable domain name but the executable must be able to bind
to all of them and ports up to 1024 usually require privileged access.

"redirecturl" : This is an array of URLs that asicseer-pool will redirect
active miners to in redirector mode. They must be valid resolvable URLs+ports.

"mindiff" : Minimum diff that vardiff will allow miners to drop to. Default 1

"startdiff" : Starting diff that new clients are given. Default 42

"maxdiff" : Optional maximum diff that vardiff will clamp to where zero is no
maximum.

"mindiff_overrides" : Optional JSON object (dictionary) of useragent, mindiff
pairs, e.g: `"mindiff_overrides" : { "nicehash" : 500000, "foohash" : 750000 }`
This is a mechanism to support a raised minimum difficulty for clients
connecting to the pool based on their "useragent" string (that they normally
send via `mining.subscribe` on initial connect).  The "useragent" specified
here is a prefix match (case insensitive).  If a client's useragent matches the
specified prefix, then it will have its minimum and starting difficulty set to
the override value.  Note: The override values specified here cannot be lower
than the pool's "mindiff" setting -- they must always be higher (similarly this
value must also be below "maxdiff").  This mechanism was initially designed so
that NiceHash clients can connect to a pool and get a special-cased raised
difficulty  (since NiceHash refuses to operate if share difficulty is < 500000
as of the time of this writing).

"logdir" : Which directory to store pool and client logs. Default "logs"

"maxclients" : Optional upper limit on the number of clients asicseer-pool will
accept before rejecting further clients.
